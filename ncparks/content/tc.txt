V. SUBMISSIONS
We are pleased to hear from our users and welcome your comments regarding the Service and the products and services offered in connection therewith. Unfortunately, however, our long-standing company policy does not allow us to accept or consider creative ideas, suggestions, or materials other than those that we have specifically requested. We employ a talented staff and consultants who may be working on the same or similar ideas. We hope you will understand that it is the intent of this policy to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings when projects developed by our professional staff and/or consultants might seem to others to be similar to their own creative work. Please do not send us any unsolicited original creative materials of any kind. While we do value your feedback on the Service and the services and products offered in connection therewith, we request that you be specific in your comments with respect to the same, and not submit any creative ideas, suggestions, or materials (unless specifically requested by us).
If, at our request, you send certain specific submissions or, despite our request, you send us creative suggestions, ideas, notes, drawings, concepts, or other information (collectively, the "Submissions"), the Submissions shall be deemed, and shall remain, our property. None of the Submissions shall be subject to any obligation of confidence on our part and we shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Submissions. Without limitation of the foregoing, we shall exclusively own all now known or hereafter existing rights to the Submissions of every kind and nature throughout the universe and shall be entitled to unrestricted use of the Submissions for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation to the provider of the Submissions.
VI. FORUMS AND PUBLIC COMMUNICATION
"Forum" means a chat area, message board, or e-mail function offered as part of the Service. If you participate in a Forum within the Service, if applicable, you must not: (i) defame, abuse, harass or threaten others; (ii) make any bigoted, hateful or racially offensive statements; (iii) advocate illegal activity or discuss illegal activities with the intent to commit them; (iv) post or distribute any material that infringes and/or violates any right of a third party or any law; (v) post or distribute any vulgar, obscene, discourteous or indecent language or images; (vi) advertise or sell to, or solicit others; (vii) use the Forum for commercial purposes of any kind other than to facilitate a transaction on the Service; (viii) post or distribute any software or other materials which contain a virus or other harmful component; or (ix) post material or make statements that do not generally pertain to the designated topic or theme of any chat room or bulletin board. You shall remain solely responsible for the content of your messages and shall indemnify and hold the Indemnified Parties harmless for the content of such messages. We reserve the right to remove or edit content from any Forum at any time and for any reason.
By uploading materials to any Forum or submitting any materials to us, you automatically grant (or warrant that the owner of such materials expressly granted) us a perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable, non-exclusive right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, publicly perform and display, create derivative works from and distribute such materials or incorporate such materials into any form, medium, or technology now known or later developed throughout the universe. In addition, you warrant that all so-called "moral rights" in those materials have been waived.
When participating in a Forum, never assume that people are who the say they are, know what they say they know, or are affiliated with whom they say they are affiliated with in any chat room, message board, or other user generated content area. Information obtained in a Forum may not be reliable, and it is not a good idea to trade or make any investment decisions based solely or largely on information you cannot confirm. We cannot be responsible for the content or accuracy of any information, and shall not be responsible for any trading or investment decisions made based on such information.
VII. CONTENT LINKED TO THE SERVICE
Links to other sites may be provided for your convenience. By providing these links, we are not endorsing, sponsoring or recommending such sites or the materials disseminated by or services provided by them, and are not responsible for the materials, services or other situations at or related to or from any other site.
Please exercise discretion while using the Service and browsing the Internet and using the Service. You should be aware that when you are using the Service, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are links to other sites from the Service web pages that take you outside of the Service. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement or a search result, the "click" may take you off the Service web page. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors, and content partners that may use our logo(s) as part of a co-branding agreement. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, solicit personal information, or contain information that you may find inappropriate or offensive. In addition, advertisers on the Service may send cookies to users that we do not control.
We reserve the right to disable links from any third party sites to the Service web pages.
We make no representations concerning the content of sites listed in any of the Service web pages. Consequently, we cannot be held responsible for the accuracy, relevancy, copyright compliance, legality or decency of material contained in sites listed in any search results or otherwise linked to the Service.

We also reserve the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, remove or edit content or cancel orders in our sole and absolute discretion.

You also agree that the Indemnified Parties are not responsible or liable in any way for injury, loss or damage to your computer or interception or use of credit card information, related to or resulting from use of the Service or any services or materials linked or related thereto or therefrom and also are not responsible or liable in any way for any injury, loss, claim or damage relating to or resulting from any part of the Service operating or not operating on computers or networks used by you or communicating with such computers or networks.
To the extent we list or link to third party products or services, our Service acts as the venue for suppliers to sell products and services (or, as appropriate, solicit offers to buy) and buyers to purchase such products and services. We are not involved in the actual transaction between buyers and suppliers. As a result, we have no control over the quality, safety or legality of the items advertised, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of suppliers to sell items or the ability of buyers to buy items. We cannot ensure that a buyer or supplier will actually complete a transaction.
We do not control the information provided by other users, which is made available through the Service. You may find other user's information to be offensive, harmful, inaccurate, or deceptive. Please use caution and common sense when using the Service. Please note that there are also risks of dealing with foreign nationals, underage persons or people acting under false pretense.
Although we intend that product descriptions contained in the Service be current and accurate, we make no warranty or representation that descriptions of products in the Service are accurate, complete, current, or reliable in any or all respects.

NEITHER WE NOR ANY OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY ARISING FROM YOUR RELIANCE UPON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICE.
Search and Directory are free services, which may be offered in connection with the Service.

The Service may contain technical inaccuracies or typographical errors or omissions. THE PROVIDER is not responsible for any typographical, photographic, technical or pricing (including without limitation mistaken hot spot rates) errors listed on our Service.
